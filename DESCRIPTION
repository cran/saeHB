Description: Provides several functions for area level of small area estimation using hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method with Univariate Normal distribution and Univariate Beta distribution for variables of interest. Some dataset produced by a data generation are also provided. The 'rjags' package is employed to obtain parameter estimates. Model-based estimators involves the HB estimators which include the mean and the variation of mean. For the reference, see Rao and Molina (2015) <doi:10.1002/9781118735855>.
